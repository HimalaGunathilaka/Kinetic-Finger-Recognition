# About the project
---
The hand is the most frequently used organ of the body for performing fine tasks. This project aims to leverage that by recognizing drawn symbols and aiding digital drawing through hand gestures.

The system involves building a glove-like wearable device capable of detecting taps and finger movements on a surface.
